# RuneAnimation

This code is a simple iOS animation with animated ellipses revolving around a rock shape. This code was implemented using the coordinates from elliptical equations and is comprised of small circle objects with the elliptical points as their coordinates. The ellipses change color as they revolve around the rock. The concept was designed by Alexis Hill.
